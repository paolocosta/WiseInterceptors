# WiseInterceptors

This project make use of AutoFac and Castle Dynamic Proxy to implement various Aspect Oriented Programming patterns.

I started with the Circuit Breaker pattern. Then the cache interceptor.

The goal is to have a complete suite of easily configurable interceptors as a starter kit for an enterprise project.
