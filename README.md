# WiseInterceptors

This project implements some C# interceptors.

Currently we have:

 1. A circuit breaker interceptor. 
 
 2. A cache interceptor.

 3. A method validation interceptor.

The goal is to have a complete suite of easily configurable interceptors as a starter kit for enterprise projects.
