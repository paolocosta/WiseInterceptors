# WiseInterceptors

This project implements some C# interceptors using Castle Dynamic Proxy and AutoFac

Currently we have:

 1. A circuit breaker interceptor. 
 
 2. A cache interceptor.

 3. A method validation interceptor.

The goal is to have a complete suite of easily configurable interceptors as a starter kit for enterprise projects.

Cache interceptor  (Work in progress)
-----------------

The cache interceptor applies the cache algorithm proposed here: https://happinessdd.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/a-new-solution-for-the-cache-stampede-problem/.

It's also possible to save cached data in a persistent storage in order to be fault tolerant with database failures.

To apply a cache interceptor to a method please give a look at the demo project.

In the Program.cs file the function BuildContainer registers the types with Autofac and applies the cache interceptor to the virtual methods of the class TimeGetter (in our case just the function Now).

The Cache class takes the cache settings by the Form1 class. The cachekey is hardcoded as we are only caching one method. In real code the cachekey can be left empty so it's automatically generated by the library according to the method parameters' value, or can be provided by the custom class implemented i the client code.
